# Helix robots.txt FAQ
#
# Q: This looks like a default robots.txt, how can I provide my own?
# A: Put a file named robots.txt into the root of your GitHub 
# repo, Franklin will serve it from there.
#
# Q: Why am I'm seeing this robots.txt instead of the one I 
# configured?
# A: You are visiting from *.hlx.page or *.hlx.live - in order 
# to prevent these sites from showing up in search engines and 
# giving you a duplicate content penalty on your real site we 
# exclude all robots 
# 
# Q: What do you mean with "real site"?
# A: If you add a custom domain to this site (e.g. 
# example.com), then Franklin detects that you are ready for 
# production and serves your own robots.txt - but only on 
# example.com
#
# Q: This does not answer my questions at all. What can I do?
# A: head over to #franklin-chat on Slack or 
# github.com/adobe/helix-home/issues and ask your question 
# there.
